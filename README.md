# Terraform Provider for Langfuse

A Terraform provider for managing [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) resources programmatically.

Langfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform that provides observability, analytics, prompt management, and evaluations for LLM applications. This provider allows you to manage organizations, projects, and API keys using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## Features

- 🏢 **Organization Management** - Create and manage Langfuse organizations
- 🔑 **API Key Management** - Generate and manage organization and project API keys
- 📦 **Project Management** - Create and configure projects within organizations
- 🛡️ **Enterprise Support** - Full support for Langfuse Enterprise features
- ⚡ **Terraform Integration** - Native integration with Terraform workflows

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.5
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.24 (for development)
- Enterprise license key (if managing organizations and organization api keys)

## Installation

### Terraform Registry (Recommended)

Add the provider to your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    langfuse = {
      source  = "langfuse/langfuse"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Development

For development and testing:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/terraform-provider-langfuse
cd terraform-provider-langfuse

# Build the provider
go build -o terraform-provider-langfuse

```

## Configuration

### Provider Configuration

```hcl
provider "langfuse" {
  host          = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"  # Optional, defaults to https://app.langfuse.com
  admin_api_key = var.admin_api_key             # Optional, can use LANGFUSE_ADMIN_KEY env var
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `LANGFUSE_ADMIN_KEY` - Admin API key (alternative to `admin_api_key`)
- `LANGFUSE_EE_LICENSE_KEY` - Enterprise license key (required for admin operations)

## Usage

### Complete Example

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    langfuse = {
      source  = "langfuse/langfuse"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Variables for configuration
variable "host" {
  type        = string
  description = "Base URL of the Langfuse control plane"
  default     = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"
}

variable "admin_api_key" {
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  description = "Admin API key for Langfuse (or set LANGFUSE_ADMIN_KEY)"
}

# Configure the provider
provider "langfuse" {
  host          = var.host
  admin_api_key = var.admin_api_key
}

# Create an organization
resource "langfuse_organization" "example" {
  name = "My Organization"
}

# Create organization API keys
resource "langfuse_organization_api_key" "example" {
  organization_id = langfuse_organization.example.id
}

# Create a project within the organization
resource "langfuse_project" "example" {
  name            = "my-project"
  organization_id = langfuse_organization.example.id
  retention_days  = 90  # Optional: data retention period

  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.secret_key
}

# Create project API keys
resource "langfuse_project_api_key" "example" {
  project_id = langfuse_project.example.id

  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.secret_key
}

# Output the API keys (marked as sensitive)
output "org_public_key" {
  value     = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.public_key
  sensitive = true
}

output "project_secret_key" {
  value     = langfuse_project_api_key.example.secret_key
  sensitive = true
}
```

### `langfuse_organization_membership`

Manages organization membership - invites users to organizations and manages their roles. This resource automatically creates users in the Langfuse system via the SCIM endpoint if they don't already exist.

#### Arguments

- `email` (String, Required, ForceNew) - The email address of the user to add to the organization
- `role` (String, Required) - The role to assign to the user. Valid values: `ADMIN`, `MEMBER`, `VIEWER`

#### Behavior

- **Automatic User Creation**: If the user doesn't exist in the organization, the resource automatically creates them using the SCIM endpoint before adding them to the organization
- **Role Updates**: The role can be updated after creation using Terraform `apply` with the updated role value
- **Deletion**: When the resource is destroyed, the user is removed from the organization (but not deleted from the Langfuse system)
- **Resource ID**: The resource ID is set to the user's `userId` from the Langfuse system, which uniquely identifies the membership within the organization

#### Example Usage

```hcl
# Create organization membership with automatic user creation
resource "langfuse_organization_membership" "engineer" {
  email                    = "engineer@example.com"
  role                     = "MEMBER"
  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.secret_key
}

# Update user role
resource "langfuse_organization_membership" "admin" {
  email                    = "admin@example.com"
  role                     = "ADMIN"
  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.secret_key
}

# Multiple users in organization
resource "langfuse_organization_membership" "team" {
  for_each = toset([
    "dev1@example.com",
    "dev2@example.com",
    "qa@example.com"
  ])

  email                    = each.value
  role                     = "MEMBER"
  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.secret_key
